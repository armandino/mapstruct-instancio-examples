# Instancio Samples Using MapStruct

This repository is a fork of [MapStruct Examples](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct-examples),
containing only a few of the original samples.

The goal of this mini-project is to demonstrate how data setup in unit tests
can be simplified using [Instancio](https://github.com/instancio/instancio).
